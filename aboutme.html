			I am <b>Jason Vuong</b> from <b>Vietnam</b>. 
			I am taking <i>CS 313 - Web Engineering</i> to fulfill
			my Bachelor Degree of Science in <i>Computer Science</i>.
			Computer Science is a big field but Web Programming is my favorite.
			I took a basic course about front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery)
			and am so excited to know that I am going to learn back-end development (PHP and mySQL).
			I will try my best to get a high grade as well as use all knowledge
			I learn from this class to pursue my dream job, a Web Engineer.</p>

			A man died and went to The Judgment, they told him ,
			"Before you meet with God, I should tell you - we've
			looked over your life, and to be honest you really
			didn't do anything particularly good or bad. We're
			not really sure what to do with you. Can you tell us
			anything you did that can help us make a decision?"
			<br/><br/>
			The newly arrived soul thought for a moment and replied,
			<br/>
			"Yeah, once I was driving along and came upon a person
			who was being harassed by a group of thugs. So I pulled
			over, got out a bat, and went up to the leader of the thugs.
			He was a big, muscular guy with a ring pierced through his
			lip. Well, I tore the ring out of his lip, and told him he
			and his gang had better stop bothering this guy or they
			would have to deal with me!"
			<br/><br/>
			"Wow that's impressive, When did this happen?"
			<br/><br/>
			"About three minutes ago," came the reply.
